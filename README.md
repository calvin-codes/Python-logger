# 🪵 Python Logger Suite

This repository provides a modular Python setup for logging and log viewing — from simple file-based loggers to WebSocket-enabled viewers.

## 📦 Components

- `paths.py` – Centralized file path management
- * Defines placeholders for log and data directories
* Enables unified path referencing across the codebase
* Avoids hardcoded values for improved maintainability
🌱 Purpose: Provides a scalable foundation for managing paths – can be extended dynamically using environment variables or config files.
- `logger_setup.py` – Logger initialization with file handling, formatting, and configurable levels
- * Initializes logger with configurable name and level
* Logs to both console and file (LOG_PATH)
* Applies consistent formatting to all outputs
* Prevents duplicate handlers when logger already exists
🔍 Purpose: Enhances debugging and observability without cluttering main application logic.
- `sample_logger.py` – Application entry point using the logging tools
- * Imports init_logger from logger_setup
* Initializes logger with level (Customize as required)
🧭 Purpose: Validates logger configuration and serves as a template for other modules.
- `log_html_live.py` – Basic log viewer for reading and displaying logs
- `log_html_with_filter.py` – Alternative viewer with enhanced parsing/filtering
- `log_html_websocket.py` – Real-time log viewing via WebSocket interface
- `project.log` – Example log file generated by the logger
